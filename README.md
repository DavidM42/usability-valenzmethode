Autohotkey Script to assist our usability study

## How it works

Autohotkey Script reacts to F3 and F4 keypresses:
* `F3` signals a positive feedback which is diplayed on the lower right screen
* `F4` does the same with positive feedback.
* Both keys also press `F2` to signal camtasia to set a marker at the current position.
